## Instructions

Welcome! This game is similar to the classic "Frogger" arcade game. Use the arrows on your keyboard to navigate the player from the grass to the water without running into any bugs. If you run into a bug, the player will be reset to the initial starting point. If you make it across to the water, you will receive an alert and the game will be reset. Enjoy!
