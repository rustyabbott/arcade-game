## Instructions

Welcome! This game is similar to the classic "Frogger" arcade game. Use the arrows on your keyboard to navigate the player from the grass to the water without running into any bugs. If you run into a bug, the player will be reset to the initial starting point. If you make it across to the water, you will receive an alert and the game will be reset. Enjoy!

1. Open index.html in a web browser.
2. Use the up arrow on your keyboard to move forward one block.
3. Use the down arrow to move backwards one block.
4. Use the right arrow to move right one block.
5. Use the left arrow to move left one block.
6. Avoid colliding with the insects.
7. Make it to the water to win!
